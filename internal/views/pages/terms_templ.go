To ensure a positive experience for everyone, we have established the following content guidelines. Please familiarize yourself with these rules before submitting material to the Azerothian Archives website. The rules also apply to content (art/writing) that is hosted externally but embedded on the site (such as images on profile pages)</p><p class=\"mb-2\">When we refer to what is permitted on the Archives. we use the guidelines set by World of Warcraft to guide what we permit. World of Warcraft is rated PEGI 12, any references to age appropriate content refers to this rating.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">We also adopt the same social contract which Blizzard added to the game. A lot of people use gaming and the roleplay community as a place to escape the woes of life. Be mindful, be respectful.</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Respect and Inclusivity:</h2><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside\"><li>Treat all members with respect, kindness, and empathy.</li><li>We have no tolerance for discriminatory behavior or comments that target another user's identity, including but not limited to aspects like <span class=\"italic\">race, gender, ability, nationality, religion, sexual orientation</span>. This may situationally include posts about In-Character behavior which relate to the above.</li><li>Strive to foster a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere that celebrates diversity and fosters a welcoming space.</li><li>No posting about real world politics, or political/religious materials of any form is allowed.</li><li>Do not name, shame, or otherwise harass other users <span class=\"font-bold\">*</span>. This is not Wyrmguard Secrets.</li><li>Do not claim any relation to another (player) character without their explicit consent.</li></ul><p class=\"mt-1 mb-2\"><span class=\"font-bold\">*</span> Publically accusing individuals, guilds, etc. of bad behavior, will lead to post deletion and can lead to account suspension depending on the severity and continuity. While such warnings may at times be warranted and needed, allowing members to target others in such a fashion is open to abuse and is thus not allowed.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">If someone is engaged in harmful behaviour on <span class=\"underline\">our website</span> please <a class=\"text-link visited:text-visitedlink hover:underline font-bold\" href=\"/contact\">contact site staff</a> about it.</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Explicit <span class=\"italic text-lg\">(harmful, erotic, etc)</span> Content:</h2><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside\"><li>Do not post or promote any content that glorifies or encourages violence, harm, or self-destructive behavior.</li><li>Avoid graphic or detailed descriptions of violent acts, including physical, emotional, or psychological, or sexual abuse.</li><li>Do not post gore or other visceral depictions of violence.</li><li>Do not share any sexually explicit, pornographic, or NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content.</li><li>Keep all descriptions, or depictions within appropriate boundaries for the age rating and what is seen in game. Leave darker subjects implied.</li><li>Avoid detailed and explicit sexual content, including but not limited to explicit text, images, or descriptions.</li><li>Refrain from posting nudity <span class=\"font-bold\">*</span>, even if not sexual in nature, refer to what we can see in game as a litmus test for what is appropriate</li><li>Refrain from linking to external NSFW content or websites.</li></ul><p class=\"my-2\">Sometimes the line can be hard to draw and the removal of content is decided entirely by the staff member that reviews the content. If you have doubts whether the content you'd like to post is inappropriate or not we encourage you to ask the staff first - it's better than having your content deleted if it's deemed to cross the line.</p><p class=\"mb-2\"><span class=\"font-bold\">*</span> We are unfortunately beholden to what the general public, lawmakers, and others consider to constitute nudity. We ask that feminine characters' nipples are adequately covered, along with both masculine and feminine characters' groins.</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Original Content and Copyright</h2><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside\"><li>Only upload and embed content that you have the right to distribute or use. Respect the intellectual property rights of others.</li><li>Do not post copyrighted material without permission, including images, text, or other media.</li><li>Always give credit to the original creators and respect their work. A credit must always be present, even if made by yourself. We will remove any content which does not have a credit attached clearly to it.</li><li>Do not edit someone else's content and claim it to be yours.</li><li>Do not edit an artist's work and post it, unless the artist explicitly, implicitly, or reasonably, allows modifications to their work under Creative Commons.</li><li>Post content in their appropriate categories.</li></ul><p class=\"my-2\"><span class=\"font-bold\">* “Credits to the artist”, or “gifted by a friend”</span> is not acceptable accreditation because it leaves the artist anonymous. Always link to the artist in the credits. Credits should make it possible for other users to find the original content creator if needed. Admins will remove content which does not meet our creditting standards.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg text-left font-bold mb-1\">Content not made by Humans</h3><p class=\"mb-2\">Until all the legal issues with generative AI, such as cralwing the internet and stealing any content that is not nailed down have been solved in a proper and acceptable manner by the comanies ot the implementation of legal measures to hold them accountable: <span class=\"font-extrabold underline\">We will not accept or allow AI generated art on our website and such content will be removed.</span></p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Spamming</h2><p class=\"mb-2\">Do not repeatedly post duplicates of the same content. We recommend compiling many snippet diary entries together if posted a short time apart. If your noticeboard item, for instance, can be found in multiple cities, include the locations in a single post rather than creating many identical copies.</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">OOC Content and Misc</h2><p class=\"mb-2\">We allow users to post out-of-character (OOC) content within reason. <span class=\"font-bold\">Examples:</span> creating a page for the guild's Roll System and image descriptions. But if there are OOC topics that you'd like to discuss, please use the realm forums for that.</p><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside\"><li>The Azerothian Archives is for roleplayers on the US servers Wyrmrest Accord and Moon Guard. Users should not register their off-server characters or guilds here.</li></ul></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Page Formatting (NYI!)</h2><p>TBD!</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 mt-2 text-sm\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Real-Life Information</h2><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside mb-2\"><li>Do not ever share any personal or private information about yourself or others. <span class=\"font-bold\">Note: </span> staff will never ask for personal information or password.</li><li>Protect your privacy and the privacy of others by avoiding the exchange of irl personal details, such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, or social media profiles. The only exception to the last one is for linking to artist portfolios for crediting purposes.</li><li>The Azerothian Archives is not an alternative for photo hosting websites. Do not upload real life photography of people, animals or objects to the Archives. We wish to stay close to the atmosphere of World of Warcraft and keep the real world imagery away from it.</li></ul></div><hr><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">The Azerothian Archive Web Team's role</h2><p class=\"mb-2\">While the Azerothian Archives supports uploading and sharing content, we do not legally endorse any content on our site. You may not post content that infringes on others' intellectual property or proprietary rights. If content is reported we reserve the right to remove it, but we do not take that action lightly. We do not screen or endorse any content on the site. If you see content that violates these terms, then let us know and we may remove it.</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">Moderation and Reporting</h2><ul class=\"ml-2 space-y-1 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside mb-2\"><li>Follow the instructions and guidance of site admins and moderators. They have final say on all matters and reserve the right to enforce the rules of this site.</li><li>Report any content that violates these guidelines to the admins and moderators through the reporting form.</li><li>Help maintain a positive environment by reporting any harmful or inappropriate behavior.</li></ul><p class=\"my-2\">If uploaded or embedded content does not follow the set rules it may be taken down. The admin team may remove any content they suspect breaks rules, if you believe a ruling was unfair or incorrect you can challenge this by using the contact form and providing details of the ruling and why you believe it to be incorrect and we will deliberate on it.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">Continuously breaking these terms or reasonable directions from admins or admins will lead to warnings, and eventually you may be banned from the site if not adhered to. Depending on severity an immediate ban may be warranted.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">Use your creativity to contribute positively to the roleplay community and have fun!</p></div><div class=\"px-4 pb-1 my-2 text-sm border-b\"><h2 class=\"text-2xl text-left font-bold mb-2\">If your art or writing has been used without your consent</h2><p class=\"mb-2\">If your art/writing has been used on the Archives without your consent, please contact the web team using the contact form or by email: PLACEHOLDER.
