# About the Athenaeum

The Athenaeum project is a web application written in Go. The application serves a website that hosts character, guild, community, etc profiles for the World of Warcraft US servers.

# Who Will This Application Serve?

Everyone who roleplays on US servers. While this is a project that started on Moon Guard (US) with cross-faction and cross-server guilds becoming a thing we are are going to mostly be ignoring servers delineation. We see no reason to exclude Wyrmrest Accord (US), Emerald Dream (US), etc players.

The only palce in the application where you will likely see realms referenced will be on guild pages, recruitment, and events (The latter mostly so you know which server to be on). For guilds, particullarly for people who only want to recruit on their realm, there will be that option.
